# GuildRecruitment--Cataclysm-4.3
 A world of Warcraft addon for Cataclysm 4.3.4

Tired of hitting that macro to recruit for your guild in world chat? This addon will do that for you. You can create a list of different recruitment ads and set the time interval between messages in game!

Note: This is specific to the the World Channel in Apollo-Wow. It is designed to work specifically in that channel name and will not send any messages otherwise.
